# Term Project for 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming

Description:
My project, Paint with Piu Piu, allows users to draw and create images on a digital canvas. Users can switch between various colors, use freehand drawing, create different shapes, erase parts of their artwork, open existing paint files, save their canvas, and receive a score for their painting.

Run:
Use control + B to run the program (Windows). After saving, there will be a
text file called paintingData that will appear in your files.
